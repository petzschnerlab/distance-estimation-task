# Distance and Turning Angle Estimation Task

## Description
### Experimental setup
Stimuli were presented binocular on a computer monitor (resolution,
1280  800; frame rate, 59 Hz) driven by an ATI Mobility Radeon HD
3400 graphics card. Experiments were conducted in complete darkness
except for the illumination by the monitor. The real-time virtual reality
(VR) was created using Vizard 3.0 (Worldviz) and depicted an artificial
stone desert consisting of a textured ground plane, 200 scattered stones,
and a textured sky (Fig. 1a). The orientation of the ground plane texture,
the position of the stones, and the starting position of the participant
within the VR were randomized in each trial to prevent participants from
using any of these as potential cues. The sky was simulated as a 3D dome
centered on the participant’s current position so that the distance to the
horizon was kept constant. The eye height in the VR was adjusted individually
to the true eye height of each participant (Daum and Hecht, 2009).
Participants used a multidirectional movable joystick (SPEEDLINK)
to navigate.

### Experimental procedure
The estimation of traveled distances and the estimation of turning angles
were tested separately under three different conditions in a production–
reproduction task (Fig. 1a).
Distance estimation experiment. Each trial started with an instruction
for participants to move forward along a linear path while keeping track
of their self-displacement. Direction of movement during production
was indicated by a visual cue at the horizon. When participants reached
the sample distance dp, movement was automatically stopped and disabled
for a few seconds. Subsequently, participants were instructed to
reproduce the perceived distance and indicate their final position via
button press. In all trials, velocity was kept constant during movement,
but changed randomly up to plus/minus 60% (scaling factor drawn from a normal
distribution) between production and reproduction phases to exclude
time estimation strategies to solve the task. To test the effect of prior
experience only, the settings for the three conditions were the same except
that the sample distances and respective turning angles were drawn
from three different underlying uniform sample distributions, specified
as small displacements (dp = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] m), intermediate
displacements (dp = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] m) and large displacements
range (dp = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] m). The
sample distributions of the three conditions were chosen to be partially
overlapping to test whether displacement estimation behavior differed
significantly for the same sample stimulus depending on the previously
experienced displacements (Fig. 1b). Participants had no knowledge
about the amount of displacement they had to reach during the production
phase and were naive to the condition in which they were tested.
Turning angle estimation experiment. The stimulus and settings in the
angle estimation (AE) experiment were identical to the distance estimation
(DE) experiment, with the following exception: participants turned
on the spot to a previously indicated direction. Turning direction was
kept constant between production and reproduction to preclude the use
of external cues to solve the task. The sample turning angles, alpha_p, for the
three prior experience conditions were in analogy drawn from three
different sample distributions specified as small displacements (alpha_p = [10,
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]°), intermediate displacements (alpha_p = 
[50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140]°) and large displacements range
(alpha_p = [90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180]°).
All participants performed both types of experiment. The three conditions
for DE and AE were tested in separate sessions, resulting in six test
sessions per participant. Each session lasted between 45 and 60 min and
was composed of 200 trials. The first 20 training trials per experimental
condition served to familiarize participants with the VR. Feedback on the
performance was given after the reproduction by displaying an object in
the VR at the correct distance or turning angle and asking subjects to
navigate toward this location. In the following 180 test trials, no feedback
was given. Only test trials were used for data analysis. Two sessions of the
same experiment type, AE or DE, were separated by at least 1 h and up to
a few days. Within sessions, participants had a short break of 100 s after
100 and 150 trials. Each sample displacement was repeated 20 times per
condition in randomized order. The same trial order within one condition
was maintained for all participants. The order in which the
three conditions for DE and AE were tested was randomized for each
participant
